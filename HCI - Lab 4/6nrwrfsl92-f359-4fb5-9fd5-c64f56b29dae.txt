Million fireflies lit up the world as I fell asleep because they fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere. You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare I'd like to make myself believe that planet Earth turns it slowly it's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep because everything is never as it seems because I get a thousand hugs from 10,000 lightning bugs as they tried to teach me how to dance a fox trot above my head a sock hop beneath my bed disco ball is just hanging by a thread thread? I'd like to make myself believe this planet Earth turn slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep because everything is never as it seems. When I fall asleep, leave my door open just to crack. Please take me away from you because I feel like such an insomniac. Please take me away from you why do I tire of counting sheep? Please take me away from you when I walk too tired to fall asleep to 10 million fireflies. I'm weird because I hate goodbyes. I got misty eyes as they said farewell but I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre because I saved if you and I keep them in a charge. I'd like to make myself believe slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep because everything is never as. It seems I'd like to make myself believe this planet Earth turns slowly. It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep because my dreams are bursting at the seam.
